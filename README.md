**About**
*HyperType* is a language and game engine rolled into one. 

The goal of *HyperType* is to provide utility and simplicity along with speed in a single app.
This means *HyperType* has many functions and classes to allow programmers to quickly create prototypes of games without having to deal with the headache of libraries and languages.
